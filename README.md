NodeCG Transition
=================

A bundle for [NodeCG](https://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) that enables video transitions between scenes!

### [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eckbASUOYEY)

### Dependencies
Requires the [OBS Remote](http://www.obsremote.com/) plugin to be installed, and [CLR Browser Source Plugin](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/clr-browser-source-plugin.22/) *(obviously)*.

### Usage
1. Setup the transitions page as a global source and add it to all your scenes.
2. Enter your OBS Remote settings in the `settings.json` file.
3. Run NodeCG, then open the Dashboard.
4. Add a new transition using the [+ Add Transition] button.
5. Select your video, then click the [+] button to upload. *Currently the only video file type that supports an alpha channel is .webm*
